# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project
Using SQL to determine employees that are eligible for retirement

### Purpose
In this challenge we were given two tasks, to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and to identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results

### Number of Retiring Employees by Title
The Unique Titles deliverable is a list of all the employees that are eligible to retire along with their corresponding titles. By getting the count of all employees retiring by title, image below, we can begin to see patterns that may prove useful.

1. The first thing I noticed about this deliverable was which positions had the most number of retirement eligible employees, there are 57, 668 Senior Engineers and Senior Staff eligible for retirement, which makes up approximately 63.79% of total employees eligible for retirement. With the possibility of so many senior employees retiring, it could create a huge disparity in knowledge and experience if those positions are not filled quickly. 

2. The second thing, out of all employees eligible for retirement, only 2 are managers. Further analysis would need to be done to determine what ages and how long each manager has been at the company to see what effects this is having on the company. But it could mean that a lot of managers are much younger and not near retirement age, there could be descrepencies with the data for managers, or this result may be expected by the company and nothing needs to be done.

### Mentorship Eligible Employees
The Mentorship Eligibility deliverable cointains a list of employees that are eligible to participate in the mentorship program by remaining on part time instead of retiring, and acting as a point of contact for new employees as they learn. By also getting the count of this list, below, we can compare it to our previous deliverable to see how effective the mentorship program may be.

1. The first thing that stands out about this deliverable is the small number of employees eligible to mentor in respect to the total number of employees retiring. There are 1,549 retirement eligible employees that are also eligible to be mentors out of the total 90,398 retirement eligible employees. 

2. The second thing is the differences in which positions have the larger number of employees in their respective deliverables. In the first, Senior Engineers (29,414), Senior Staff (28,254), then Engineers (14,222) are the top three number of retirement eligible. However, when looking at the number of employees that are mentor eligible, the top three are Senior Staff (467), Engineers (443), then Staff (257).

## Summary

### How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
- There are a total of 90,398 employees that are eligible for retirement. With the majority being in senior level positions, there are not just a ton of positions to be filled, but a ton of positions that require well educated and trained employees in order to be successful. These senior level positions are also likely to pay more, which means the company will need to be prepared to pay for the new hires as well. 

### Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
- That depends on how many new employees each mentor is able to successfully train. Looking at the Senior Staff positions, we see that there are 28,254 retirement eligible employees and 467 eligible mentors. If every eligible employee retired or mentored, that would mean there would be 28,254 new employees that needed to be trained. The mentors would have to train around 61 new employees apiece to cover them all. It's unlikely that mentors would be able to succesfully train that many new employees.
